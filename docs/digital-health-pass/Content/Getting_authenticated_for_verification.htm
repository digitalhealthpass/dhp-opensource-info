        <p>Prior to verifying — for example, if you're going to start work and scan health passes for customers at a restaurant  — make sure that you have a current, valid verifier credential.</p>
        <p><b>To get authenticated for verification:</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> Verify app, scan the QR code for your verifier credential. Your organization provides you with the verifier credential.<br /><br />Where you'll find your credential differs. For example, your organization         might email your credential, which you can scan from a computer display. Alternately, your organization might print your credential and post at it your workplace, where you can scan the copy.</li>
            <li>Check the credential for validity.          Make sure you're using it prior to its expiration date.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>If the Verify app displays an error message</b>
        </p>
        <p>If you scan a QR code and Verify displays a <b>No Organization</b> or <b>You don't have a valid organization...</b> message, make sure that you're scanning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A current, valid credential (not expired)           </li>
            <li>A verifier credential (not another type of QR code)            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you have questions, contact your onsite Verifier Coordinator.</p>
