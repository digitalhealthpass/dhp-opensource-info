            <MadCap:keyword term="verifiers:verifier credentials:adding" />Adding a verifier credential</h2>
        <p>A valid, non-expired <b>verifier credential</b> is required for verifiers to use the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> Verify mobile application to scan and verify holder health passes and cards. In addition, the credential enables the Verify app to submit metrics for completed scans.  You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Issue a single verifier credential to all verifiers        </li>
            <li>Issue each verifier their own verifier credentials         </li>
            <li>Issue different groups of verifiers different verifier credentials           </li>
        </ul>
        <p>With the Verify app, the verifier can scan, store, and switch between multiple verifier credentials. </p>
        <p>Each credential has an <MadCap:keyword term="verifiers:verifier credentials:expiration date;expiration date"></MadCap:keyword><b>expiration date</b>, which you can set based on your organization's needs. For example, for a sports event, one-day expiration might be suitable. Alternately, if your organization sets up a verifier annually, you can set credential expiration to 365 days.</p>
        <p><b>Example</b>
        </p>
        <p>Let's say that an event management company is using <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> to verify attendees at events. The company can add a verifier credential for each gate at a venue, and either assign all verifiers at that gate the same credential, or assign each individual verifier their own verifier credentials. For each verifier credential, the company can specify an expiration date for the verifier credential, based on the event date. When a gate staff member starts work, he'll typically scan a credential to start a verification session, and the credential will remain valid through its expiration date.</p>
