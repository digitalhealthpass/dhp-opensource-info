        <p>Verifier credentials are a specific type of credential.  A verifier credential (figure)&#160;is required to allow the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> Verify mobile app to be used by verifiers. Once the verifier app is used to either scan or select a previously-scanned verification credential, the verifier can scan holder credentials, for example, health passes and cards.</p>
