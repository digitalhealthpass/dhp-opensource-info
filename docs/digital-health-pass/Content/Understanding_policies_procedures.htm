        <p>With the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName"></MadCap:variable> solution, verifying organizations — for example, airlines, worksites and entertainment venues — have flexibility to verify credentials based on location-specific criteria. Make sure that you're completing verification appropriately. </p>
        <p><b>Examples</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In addition to requiring a valid health pass when scanning QR codes, your procedures might require also checking <MadCap:keyword term="picture ID" />picture ID for added verification.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you scan a health pass that is <MadCap:keyword term="invalid passes, cards" />invalid or <MadCap:keyword term="expired passes, cards:organization policies" />expired, your organization might provide specific guidance. For instance, you might be required to share with the pass holder the reason that the pass is invalid, as it appears in the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> Wallet. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>If you're an onsite administrator</b>
        </p>
        <p>If you administer use of <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> at your business, plan your policies and procedures well in advance. Provide adequate support and training, so verifiers know what steps to take <a href="If_something_is_wrong_with_pass_card.htm">if something is wrong with a pass or card</a>. </p>
