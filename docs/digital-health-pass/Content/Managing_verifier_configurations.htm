            <MadCap:keyword term="customer profiles" />Managing verifier configurations</h2>
        <p><MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> customers need to routinely update verifier configurations to stay current with verification requirements for healthcare credentials. Evolving healthcare events involve changing guidance, for example, from a company, school district, or a health authority, such as the CDC in the United States. In the greater population, with organizations and credential holders, there's a great deal of flux and on-going change. Challenges in staying current include, for example, available vaccines, credential types, and rules and policies affecting credential validity. </p>
        <p>In a <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> deployment, customers want to validate credential holders according to the latest guidance. When customers use the <MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> Verify app to scan and validate credentials, they want to use up-to-date criteria when determining whether a credential is valid (green) or invalid (red).<MadCap:variable name="Variables.ProductName" /> administrators facilitate this by maintaining customers' verifier configurations.</p>
        <p><b>Examples of common administration tasks</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Update configuration values, for example, to change the validity time period for a vaccination</li>
            <li>Enabling or disabling rules           </li>
            <li>Remove configurations from the configuration catalog            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Caveats</h3>
        <p>Before proceeding: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure that you understand what the customer wants to accomplish with the update.           </li>
            <li>Carefully consider any affect or impacts of your update.            </li>
        </ul>
